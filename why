Core Framework & Build Tools

React with TypeScript: Chosen for building a robust, type-safe single-page application. TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, helping catch errors early and improve code maintainability.
Vite: Used as the build tool because it's significantly faster than alternatives like Create React App, offering instant server start and hot module replacement.
Styling & UI Components

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with pre-built classes. It's used throughout the project for responsive design and consistent styling.
shadcn/ui: A collection of reusable components built on top of Radix UI. Used for:
Form inputs (Input, Select)
Buttons and interactive elements
Modals and dialogs
Toast notifications
Lucide React: Provides a comprehensive set of icons used throughout the UI for better visual communication.
State Management & Data Fetching

TanStack Query (React Query): Used for managing server state and data fetching. It provides:
Automatic caching
Background data updates
Loading and error states
Optimistic updates
Routing

React Router DOM: Handles client-side routing, enabling navigation between different pages:
/dashboard: Main book browsing page
/login & /register: Authentication pages
/add-book: Book submission page
/my-books: User's book management
/profile: User profile page
Form Handling

React Hook Form: Used for form management with:
Built-in validation
Performance optimization
Easy form state management
Zod: Type validation library integrated with React Hook Form for robust form validation
